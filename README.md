### Hi there 👋

My name is Jan and these are some of my repositories. You can find some more over at [https://gitlab.com/JanGregor](https://gitlab.com/JanGregor) (because we need more diversity in our git hosts).

By day you can usually find me hosting 🎙️ the [programmier.bar podcast](https://www.programmier.bar/) (🇩🇪) with my the folks over at Lotum.
By night you can sometimes find me blogging over at [my blog](https://www.jangregor.me) - just kidding, usually I end up playing some video games instead.

Earlier in my life...
- I worked in web development / consulting,
- helped to grow [LILLYDOO](https://www.lillydoo.com/) from a small startup to a multimillion dollar company and led an engineering team of ~50 people as VP Development/IT,
- joined Shopify 🇨🇦 as Manager for the Developer Relations / Developer Advocacy team in EMEA 🌍 and met a lot of cool developers and companies all across Europe, North America and Australia.

I value quality in my projects, workflows and processes and am a huge fan of a hollistic approach to the software craft.

Hit me up!
